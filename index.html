            <small>Hello Everyone!</small>
            <p><small>My name is Masayuki Sakamoto and I’m first student of University of Ritsumeikan, college of information science and engineering. I have been to Abbotsford, Canada for two and half years to study English. I want to be IT engineer in the future so I’m studying at the university right now. I would like to set up a business in the future. From the ISSE course, PBL and TBL, I understand that I cannot set up a business by myself and I need to find a person who has different knowledge from me. So while staying at university I would like to find and attract these kinds of people, and to do that I think I need to study abroad to find and meet with them. During the stay in canada, which is a country that boasts 60% of its population originating from a different ethnic group. During this time I experienced multiculturalism on different levels such as at my school, with friends, and in social situations.  I have come to understand that in society, there needs to be the ability to creatively construct solutions that integrate conflicting opinions and interpretations. This enlightenment has influenced my choices up until now and will continue into my future. </small></p>
